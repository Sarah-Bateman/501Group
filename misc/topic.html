<h1>Online Learning - Student Experience</h1>


</ul><h5><p>The page or area describing your chosen technology/topic and why it is significant and/or has important implications for society.<p></h5>
<p>Online learning provides an intriguing and disruptive alternative to traditional institutions of learning. This new paradigm, enabled by technological advances in computing and networking, allows individuals to engage in learning and education remotely. This is done through interaction with online learning resources generally in the form of text images and video (Singh & Thurman, 2019). Online learning also allows for two-way communication through instant messaging, the sharing of files and even real time video chat between individuals like students and teachers (Singh & Thurman, 2019).</p>
<p>Online learning can lead to students spending less time in physical locations of education. This can have several benefits such as giving students greater flexibility around when and how they study, reducing time spent commuting and reducing the financial burden of attending a physical location of learning (Tareen & Haand, 2020). Online learning, however, can also lead to less direct in person interaction with educators, role models and peers. This can lead to increased isolation, anxiety and depression for students (Bolatov et al., 2021). It is clear to us that online learning has the potential to significantly improve or erode student wellbeing and therefore the topic warrants further investigation into its implications and what can be done to maximise benefits and mitigate harms.

<p><em>When deciding on your chosen technology/topic, it is best not to choose something too broad, but limit the focus e.g. consider the level of social analysis from the figure below.</p></em>
<p><em>E.g. What is the level of analysis - culture or organization; Responsibility - individual or pro fessional; Ethical issue - power or equity; Technology - medical, nuclear, mobile?</p></em>
