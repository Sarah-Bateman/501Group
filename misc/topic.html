  <h1>Online Learning - Student Experience</h1>


  <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0 1rem;">
    In the past four decades the way our world connects and communicates has transformed greater and faster than ever
    before. In the 1980s the world was introduced to electronic mail (email) and the internet. The creation of the World
    Wide Web, the first web browsers and the first search engines changed the way we accessed information globally.
    Within a few years mobile computers in the form of laptops and mobile phones became commonplace and could access the
    internet from virtually anywhere. Today there is rarely a single person who does not have access to some form of
    internet connected technology.<br><br>With this boom in internet and mobile enabled communications came a shift in the way
    educational institutions shared and accessed resources amongst faculty and students. Today, learning resources such
    as textbooks and assignments are mostly distributed/submitted online with schools and universities embracing the
    introduction of cloud-based services such as Google Classroom, Microsoft Office, and Blackboard just to name a few.
    For most institutions, online services have merely made teaching more efficient and easily accessible to students on
    campus and at home. However, some institutions are taking online education to the next level, offering certificates,
    diplomas and degrees fully online for a fraction of the cost of on-campus education, if the students have a computer
    and a simple internet connection. Whilst online education has existed for many years, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a
    surge in online training and education.
