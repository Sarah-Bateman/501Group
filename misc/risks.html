  <h1>Technology Risks</h1>

  <p>Online learning does, however, present several significant risks. Firstly, online learning has been shown to
    significantly reduce the grades attained by students when compared to traditional in person education <a href="references.html">(Xu et al.,
      2013)</a>. Secondly, online learning increases the number of students that drop out of education <a href="references.html">(Xu et al., 2013)</a>.
    Thirdly, students have experienced a significant increase in mental health issues as a result of switching to online
    learning <a href="references.html">(Garcia et al., 2021.)</a>. Finally, the combination of these factors has the potential to compound creating a
    generation with decreased technical proficiency, reduced educational attainment and ongoing self-reinforcing mental
    health difficulties that hamper both their wellbeing and interpersonal skills <a href="references.html">(Hawkley et al., 2010)</a>.

    Xu (2013) found that in a community college setting online learning led to an 8% reduction in grade point average.
    Poorer learning outcomes were not evenly distributed across populations <a href="references.html">(Bird et al., 2022)</a>. Poorer performing
    students, ethnic minorities, gender minorities and students from a less privileged socioeconomic background were all
    disproportionately negatively affected by the move to online learning. This implies that a move to online learning
    is likely to most negatively affect the most vulnerable in society.

    Student failure to complete courses increased by 7% because of the move to online learning. This is roughly in line
    with the reduction in grade point attainment found by Xu (2013). Again, these results were biased towards the most
    societally vulnerable students in the programs. This reduction in education attainment has significant implication
    for both the lifelong productivity and wellbeing of these students and society as a whole. This is especially true
    given that these students are likely to be those with the least options with regards to alternative earning
    opportunities. An 8% reduction in grades may seem small on an individual level but when we zoom out to see the
    resulting 7% reduction in the skilled workforce the scale of the issue becomes more apparent.

    The detrimental impact of online learning on student mental health may, however, be even greater than the impact of
    grades or pass rates. Online learning has been associated with a 50% increase in major depressive disorder and
    associated boost in generalized anxiety disorder <a href="references.html">(Chrikovet et al., 2020)</a>. Both of these diagnoses mean that the
    students suffering from them are undergoing clinically significant distress, impairment or both. These are not minor
    inconveniences. Three of the primary contributing factors are: technical inaccessibility in an online environment,
    increased difficulty with maintaining the workload and loneliness <a href="references.html">(Garcia et al., 2021) (Rahali et al., 2020)</a>.

    Technical limitations come in two primary forms, a lack of access to technology and a lack of technical skills to
    operate in an online environment. A lack of access to technology is most likely to be seen in minority communities
    and students of a lower socioeconomic background. These groups are also the least likely to have been exposed to a
    wide range of technologies in their home lives and as a result have the greatest technical skills deficits
    <a href="references.html">(Chrikovet et al., 2020)</a>. Unsurprisingly, these are some of the communities that we have seen to be most negatively
    impacted by the move to online learning. To address this deficit significant investment in both hardware and skills
    training for these communities is required.

    Addressing technical deficiencies is a critical first step in achieving parity in perceived workload between online
    and in-person learning. Lack of quality teaching interaction and lack of motivation (Garcia et al., 2021) were also
    seen as additional barriers to students managing course workloads. The lack of quality teacher interaction does not
    appear to be caused by teaching staff failing to interact. Significantly more hours are required by teaching staff
    in an online learning environment to achieve the same interaction as an in-person course (Dumford et al., 2018). To
    address this teaching institutions will have to allocate more teaching hours to each course to achieve the same
    student engagement and guidance as in-person classes. Finally, lack of motivation is driven by a lack of interaction
    with peers and isolation.

    Isolation is perhaps the most intractable issue of online learning. Lack of interaction with peers is a clear and
    natural consequence of online learning. For many students this can lead to loss of motivation and loneliness (Garcia
    et al., 2021). Loneliness can lead to increases in anxiety and depression (Hawkley et al., 2010), symptomologies
    that have caused clear issues as a result of online learning. Some students, conversely, say that online learning
    helps with their feelings of anxiety because they find that big classrooms with many students can trigger their
    anxiousness (Garcia et al., 2021). Unfortunately, this may not be the benefit that it initially appears. Exposure to
    stimuli that stimulate fear while in a safe environment is critical to growing confidence and becoming a more
    capable person. If instead we avoid situations that trigger our anxiety, we will reinforce the fear and can even
    develop a phobia. This is one of the most robust findings in psychology (Rachman 1968). By providing online learning
    we may be increasing anxiety and loneliness for those who crave interaction and robbing those who prefer isolation
    of the challenging experiences required for growth.

    Loneliness can be seen as a vicious self-reinforcing cycle (Hawkley et al., 2010). Lonely individuals often feel
    that they lack opportunities for interaction. Over time they can become fearful of the types of situations that
    enable social interaction, causing them to avoid the precise situations that would allow them to alleviate their
    loneliness and the anxiety that has built atop it. By placing young adults, adolescents and recently even children
    in isolated learning environments we may be creating the perfect conditions for this vicious cycle to take root.
