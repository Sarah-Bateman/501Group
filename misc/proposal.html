            >Online learning is a new method of delivering education and
            learning enabled by the internet. It allows individuals to learn
            from anywhere, potentially saving time and resources. This may
            enable people to access education when they lack the resources to
            engage with the traditional institutions of learning. Online
            learning may, however, lead to less face-to-face human interactions.
            This lack of interaction may lead to Isolation, loneliness, anxiety
            and depression. It could even exacerbate trends of falling birth
            rates in developed countries. For these reasons online learning is
            an interesting and important phenomenon that has the potential to
            alter society in impactful ways for both the better and the
            worse.</em
